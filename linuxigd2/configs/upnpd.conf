# Should the daemon insert or append rules in the forward chain.

# later in the chain.
# This option only applies if "create_forward_rules = yes".
#
# Tip: If you need to insert rules somewhere in the middle of the
# FORWARD chain, instead of first or last, then you should create a
# new empty chain, e.g forwardUPnP, and set forward_chain_name to that
# chain. Then insert a rule to jump to forwardUPnP in the appropriate
# place in the FORWARD chain. (The value of forward_rules_append
# probably won't matter much in that case.)
